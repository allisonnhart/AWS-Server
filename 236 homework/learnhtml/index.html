        <h1>I Wanted To Cry Looking At This Code</h1>
        
        <h2>For starters</h2>
        <p> Many thoughts go through my head looking at all this text,
        such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is all the red stuff?</li>
            <li>What do all these words mean?</li>
            <li>Will I ever understand the red words?</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em><strong>These are all good questions.</strong></em></p>
        <hr>
        
        <h2>However</h2>
        <p>I have to learn it eventually so here's my attempt at
        understanding all the <em>fancy</em> coding things.</p>
